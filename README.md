# OnionNet-2
OnionNet-2 is constructed based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the protein-ligand binding affinity. One of the greatest advantages of OnionNet-2 is that it can achieve higher accuracy at a lower computational cost. When taking CASF-2016 and CASF-2013 as benchmark, OnionNet-2 shows strong scoring power.

## Installation
First, create a conda environment and install some necessary packages for running OnionNet-2.
  
    conda create -n RAbinding python=3.8
    conda activate RAbinding
  
    conda install numpy
    conda install pandas
    conda install scikit-learn=0.22.1
    conda install -c openbabel openbabel
    conda install -c conda-forge mdtraj

Or, you can also use pip to install above packages. For example,
    
    pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.3

## Usage
### 1. Prepare the PDB file containing the 3D structure of protein-ligand complexes.
In the samples/prepare_complexes directory, we provide two scripts to conveniently prepare the PDB file containing 3D structure of the protein-ligand complex.
    
    # Specify the relative path or absolute path of the working directory correctly. For example, 
    bash prepare_PDB_file.sh ..

### 2. Generate the residue-atom contact features.

    python generate_features.py -h
    python generate_features.py -shells N -inp inputs_complexes.dat -out output_featurs.csv

The input file (inputs_complexes.dat) contains the path of the protein-ligand complexes pdb files, for example
    
    1a30/1a30_complex.pdb
    1bcu/1bcu_complex.pdb

### 3. Train the convolutional neural network.
    
    # The features and the real pKa are concated in a common file as the input of the training process. We can execute this process with a script.   
    python concat_features_pKa.py -inp_features output_features.csv -inp_true all_complexes_pKa.csv -out output_features_pKa.csv
    
    # The training process will output 3 files, the default are "logfile", "bestmodel.h5" and "train_scaler.scaler"ï¼Œ of which the latter two will be the input of the prediction process. 
    python train.py -h
    python train.py -train_file train_features_pKa.csv -valid_file valid_features_pKa.csv -shape 84 124 1 

### 4. Predict the protein-ligand binding affinity.

    python predict_pKa.py -h
    python predict_pKa.py -scaler train_scaler.scaler -model bestmodel.h5 -inp input_features.csv -out predicted_pKa.csv
